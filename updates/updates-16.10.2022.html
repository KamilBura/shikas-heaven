<h1>Site Update 16.10.2022</h1>

<div class="SH-main-text position-relative">
    Changes in Code
</div>

<div class="SH-under-main-text position-relative">
    The Website code has been, i would like to say "Cleaned". It's more understandable than
    before. Sites which has been changed are | Index(Main), Updates, Wiki, Events, About,
    Minecraft Server |. 
</div>

<div class="SH-main-text position-relative">
    New Color Palete
</div>
<div class="SH-under-main-text position-relative">
    I have decided to change the Website color Palete, which you can find on the Github in file
     => colors.css<br>
    For this time the website will be little Dark blue and cyan, of course some Elements
    of the Webstie will be in darker green. 
</div>

<div class="SH-main-text position-relative">
    Wiki Page is Already Accesible 
</div>
<div class="SH-under-main-text position-relative">
    I have decided to already Launch the Wiki Page, but it is not Working in 100%, of course the Website
    is accesible but the Craftings, Categories, etc. Are still W.I.P (Work in Progress).
</div>

<div class="SH-main-text position-relative">
    New Site incomming!
</div>
<div class="SH-under-main-text position-relative">
    I am planning on Publishing completely new Site, which is doesn't related with this Project. Site will be easy and Clear, the Webstie will work as a Portfolio.
    Nothing more nothing less.
</div>

<div class="SH-main-text position-relative">
    Minecraft Server Updates
</div>
<div class="SH-under-main-text position-relative">
    The Server is going to the good path, of being released. The Abilities are still in Working, i thing next week, it would be Finished, and updated to the Website.
</div>

<div class="SH-main-text position-relative">
    Report Page... Maybe. and of Course! 
</div>
<div class="SH-under-main-text position-relative">
    I'm was thinking about adding a New Page to this Project, called "Report" Page. Where you can Report bugs, Cheaters, etc.
    It may be a Problem, looking at my Skill Level right now, but i will come with a Solution, and Update the Website. Of course before test it. if everything is working etc.
    But i got through it, and got it to Work to 100%.
</div>

<div class="SH-main-text position-relative">
    New Navigation Bar
</div>
<div class="SH-under-main-text position-relative">
    Navigation Bar has been renewed, to look more Futuristic, and Better. Now it works with Window Resizing, which is the most
    hated thing by Me. I'm happy that it is working, like i want it to work, and hope i will not Break it :D.
