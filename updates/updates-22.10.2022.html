    Soo... I will tell you the whole Problem, that will unable and of course take more Time.
    So there is something called Protocol, which tell the Client(Minecraft) whole stuff, like
    Inventory, Recipes, etc. The server don't have a limit, how many it can send to Client, but
    the Client have a limit to 2MB, which is a problem for the moment right now. The Server, which
    i used to make, have a lot of Recipes, which is taking whole Memory, and the Client is unable, to
    connect with the Server.

    Soo... What now ?

<div class="SH-under-main-text position-relative">
    For the moment right now, i planning a Plan B, which will be a Server based on Plugins and Mods.
    I'm Building a Modpack right now, and posting it on CurseForge. Where you can Download it easly,
    but of course the Modpack will be posted here, and the whole Tutorial for the dummies, to how to download
    and install it.
